Description :
=============
CLI to build  Single elevator's car cabin controller. Elevator control is based on two basic principles.
  1: Continue to travel in the current elevator movement direction(up or down) while there are still remaining requests in that same elevator movement direction.
  2: If there are no further requests in that direction, then stop and become idle, or change direction if there are requests in the opposite direction.
  elevator's in cabin floor call for each floor and only one hall floor call for each floor are considered. So when either in cabin floor call or hall floor call is active, then floor call for that floor is active and simulate, floor call as request for that floor and implemented elevator control principles.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. It can be used as the open source and freeware.
